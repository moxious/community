## What's a Community?

> A community is a social unit (a group of living things) with commonality such as norms, religion, values, customs, or identity.

## Gemeinschaft & Gesellschaft

A slight detour into two German words of interest:

- Gemeinschaft, i.e. "community", which is based on roles, values, and beliefs based on shared interactions, and is driven by intrinsic motivation
- Gesellschaft, i.e. "society", Based on indirect interactions, impersonal roles, formal values, driven by extrinsic motivation

Gesellschafts are typically like corporations!

- Fundamentally based on formalized roles and has an inherent structure
- Part of why you are here is literally called compensation (for the time and effort you are not spending on hobbies, which often have communities)
- Still: Any healthy company relies heavily on its internal culture and thus internal community

## What they are Not

Because community engagement is based on instinct motivation and a drive to be a part of this community, it’s important to respect the expectations of the community. It’s a place to interact, build relationships, learn something, share knowledge. It’s not an opportunity for us to sell or do targeted marketing.

Many communities tend to view any type of commercial activity or vendor pitches targeted at their gatherings as a breach of trust.

## Making Common Cause

Extending further on what a community is not, it’s important to understand what makes a community healthy. 

A common cause is essential to a healthy community. A common cause around a professional community is learning and using the skills of that community (e.g. project management). The common cause it what everyone member of the community rallies around. Additionally trust and respect are foundational, considering communities are social units. 

Additionally, a healthy community depends on open, honest, and reliable communication. Community members and particularly organizers must be open and transparent about our intentions when engaging with the community. That is why we’re committed to creating opportunities for engagement that are rooted in knowledge sharing and learning from each other, such as meetups and discussion forums. 

Lastly, it’s essential to understand that communities often overlap, and we call them affinity communities. Healthier together, when we collaborate with other communities we have the opportunity to introduce our common cause to other common causes.

## Why Care?

If you know what your common cause is, you should care about community because it's how that common cause
spreads across people. You may want to create a situation where people can get started with a software product
with a low barrier to entry, you might be a social activist, a D&D player, or even a member of a
spiritual community.

You should care about your community and treating it well, because that's how your cause spreads.

Imagine our common cause is that we love Dungeons & Dragons.

We treat our communities well by facilitation events, answering questions, mentoring, and speaking. Community members
in turn take the journey of starting out as passive members barely aware that there is a D&D game in their town,
all the way up to (hopefully) one day being a champion of their local community. 

**Everybody wins because there are more people to play with**.

## Increasing Contributions

Communities are self-perpetuating.  Put simply, what they most want is more of their own community, in order to pursue the common cause, whatever it might be.  They often run into participation inequality pretty early though.
