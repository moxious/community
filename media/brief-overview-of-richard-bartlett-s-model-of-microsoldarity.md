### Summary

The speaker introduces the concept of micro solidarity by Richard Bartlett, which is a model for community organization that emphasizes the significance of various group sizes. The model outlines five scales of groups: the self (individual), the dyad (two people, such as a romantic or work pair), the crew (a small group, like a team), the congregation (a network of crews, such as a small startup or local scene), and the network of congregations (a large group). The idea stresses that different group sizes serve different purposes and that not all communities should aim to be enormous. It also touches on Dunbar's number, which suggests a cognitive limit to the number of stable relationships one can maintain, influencing the effectiveness and intimacy of groups. Finally, the speaker mentions the organizer of this method, Rich Desibells, and concludes the session.

 Hi, everybody. I'd like to cover a different model of community organization and thinking about community. Today, this is called micro solidarity from Richard Bartlett to kind of summarize everything. I'm just going to put this graphic up on the screen. And we're going to go through what this graphic means and what the practice of micro solidarity is about. So on this particular site micro solidarity, he has an article here called the five scales of micro solidarity. And basically it's just this. Different size groups are good for different things. And so typically when we're dealing with open source community organization or communities around companies or brands, the goal is always size, size, size, size. It's all about making the biggest possible community. But communities come in absolutely all sizes. And it's not right to make all of them enormous. Richard Bartlett points out that different size groups are good for different things. So the first is the self. That's just one person. If you've ever heard of IFS or any of the therapy modalities like that, you can look at an individual person as a group of entities discussing things with itself. The second is a diet. That's two people. It could be a romantic partnership or it could be a work relationship. The third is a crew. That could be a small group of people. You know, in startup terms, they sometimes talk about a one or a two pizza team. And I think that that's kind of what Richard is after with a crew. A congregation starts to be an interrelated set of crews. And so this would be anything up to a small startup company or your local music scene perhaps. And then finally, you can have a network of congregations. And then that can be blown up to any kind of size group that you would want. This goes through all of that. And basically, he has some great information in here about how the group size affects the number of relationships that can be had. So because we're all limited by Dunbar's number, as the size of the group increases, the number of relationships potentially explodes, except people can't have that many relationships. And so there end up being a limit to how many people you can have a relationship with and hence how effective a group can be and how internet a group can be. So the last thing that I want to put here before we sign off for this is I'm going to show you a picture of the organizer of this method. This is Rich Desibells otherwise known as the provides coaching online and that's it for today.
