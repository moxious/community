### Summary

The speaker introduces the concept of micro solidarity, a model developed by Richard Bartlett focused on understanding the appropriate size of communities for different functions. Traditionally, community organization aims for the largest possible groups. However, Bartlett's model breaks down communities into five scales: the self (one person), a dyad (two people), a crew (a small group), a congregation (a collection of crews), and a network of congregations (a large group). Each scale has its own strengths and capabilities in fostering relationships, governed by Dunbar's number, which limits the number of meaningful relationships one can maintain. The speaker emphasizes the importance of fitting the group size to its purpose instead of aiming for maximum size.

 Hi, everybody. I'd like to cover a different model of community organization and thinking about community. Today, this is called micro solidarity from Richard Bartlett to kind of summarize everything. I'm just going to put this graphic up on the screen. And we're going to go through what this graphic means and what the practice of micro solidarity is about. So on this particular site micro solidarity, he has an article here called the five scales of micro solidarity. And basically it's just this. Different size groups are good for different things. And so typically when we're dealing with open source community organization or communities around companies or brands, the goal is always size, size, size, size. It's all about making the biggest possible community. But communities come in absolutely all sizes. And it's not right to make all of them enormous. Richard Bartlett points out that different size groups are good for different things. So the first is the self. That's just one person. If you've ever heard of IFS or any of the therapy modalities like that, you can look at an individual person as a group of entities discussing things with itself. The second is a diet. That's two people. It could be a romantic partnership or it could be a work relationship. The third is a crew. That could be a small group of people. You know, in startup terms, they sometimes talk about a one or a two pizza team. And I think that that's kind of what Richard is after with a crew. A congregation starts to be an interrelated set of crews. And so this would be anything up to a small startup company or your local music scene perhaps. And then finally, you can have a network of congregations. And then that can be blown up to any kind of size group that you would want. This goes through all of that. And basically, he has some great information in here about how the group size affects the number of relationships that can be had. So because we're all limited by Dunbar's number, as the size of the group increases, the number of relationships potentially explodes, except people can't have that many relationships. And so there end up being a limit to how many people you can have a relationship with and hence how effective a group can be and how internet a group can be. So the last thing that I want to put here before we sign off for this is I'm going to show you a picture of the organizer of this method. This is Rich Desibells otherwise known as the provides coaching online and that's it for today.
