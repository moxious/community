# How to Contribute

At this point of the project, we are primarily interested in people adding
new resources to `media.json`, with blog posts, videos, and articles about
community topics that are of interest to you.

Simply pointing out where the good stuff is helps a lot. Open a PR against this
repo's `media.json` file by adding a new record like this:

```
    {
        "name": "Community Idea Introduction",
        "type": "video",
        "author": "moxious",
        "url": "https://youtu.be/j36lhnAiJ0g",
        "summary": "This video introduces the idea of this repository, and what it is for"
    }
```

For "type", you can choose your own.  Suggestions include:
* `video`
* `blog`
* `presentation`
* `book`
* `other` if nothing else fits

## What can I contribute?

This is going to be an open source repository, so we want only things which:

1. Are publicly available
2. Have the author's permission (we plan to expose text summaries and use this information downstream)

If you are the author, please identify yourself in the PR. If you are not, it would help to merge your PR
to have the author's permission, so they know what is happening.

## What can I **not** contribute?

1. Copyrighted books whose full text is not online
2. Works without the author's permission (these will be removed on request)
